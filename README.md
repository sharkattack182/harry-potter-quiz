# Harry Potter Quiz

## Purpose
This was a homework assignment for my bootcamp through UNC Charlotte. Since graduation I have decided to start going back over all the course work to freshen up and keep all my skills sharp. The great thing about this is that I can go through these projects and assess my progress. In the bootcamp I had an A average. This homework assignment was the reason I could'nt bump my grade to an A+. This assignment kicked my butt. I ran into all kinds of issues and barely had a functioning quiz when I turned it in.

## Process
This time around was much different. The javascript logic all made sense. I didnt run into a single problem I couldnt solve with a few quick searches. The overall idea of the project was to build a timed quiz with multiple choice questions. It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. Another key aspect of the assignment was working with local storage. After the user completes the quiz they will be propted to enter their name and their score will be saved to local storage and retrieved whenever they view the highscores page.
